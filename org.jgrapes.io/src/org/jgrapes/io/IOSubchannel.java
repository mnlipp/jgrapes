/**
 * Represents a subchannel for grouping input and output events related
 * to an I/O resource such as an opened file or a network connection.
 * 
 * An I/O subchannel has an initiator that creates and manages the subchannel.
 * Events fired by the initiator are said to flow downstream on the channel.
 * Events fired by components in response are said to flow upstream.
 * 
 * Upstream and downstream events are usually handled by two different pipelines
 * managed by the initiator. One pipeline, accessible only to the initiator,
 * handles the downstream events. The other, made available as a property of the
 * I/O subchannel (see {@link #responsePipeline()} and {@link #respond(Event)}), 
 * handles the upstream events. Of course, any pipeline can be
 * used to send events upstream to the initiator component. However, using
 * arbitrary pipelines holds the risk that events aren't delivered in the
 * intended order.
 * 
 * An I/O subchannel also provides associated buffer pools for byte buffers
 * and character buffers. Buffers used in responses (upstream events)
 * should be acquired from these pools only. The initiator should initialize 
 * the pools in such a way that it suits its needs.
