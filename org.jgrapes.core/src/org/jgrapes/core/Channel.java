/**
 * Instances of this interface can be used as a communication 
 * bus for sending events between components. The instances work
 * as identifiers of channels. Their only functionality is defined
 * by the {@link Eligible} interface, which allows a channel
 * (used as attribute of an {@link Event}) to be matched against 
 * a criterion specified in a {@link Handler}.
 * 
 * The need to use the {@link Eligible} interface for comparison
 * arises from the fact that we cannot use objects as values in
 * annotations. It must therefore be possible to match channels
 * (objects) against criteria that can be expressed as constant 
 * values.
 * 
 * Some values have been defined to represent special criteria.
 * 
 * * If the value `Channel.class` is specified as criterion in
 *   a handler, all channel instances match. It is the "catch-all"
 *   criterion.
 * 
 * * If the value `{@link Default}.class` is specified as criterion
 *   in a handler, the channels from an {@link Event} are
 *   matched agains the criterion from the component's channel
 *   (returned by the {@link Manager#channel() channel()} method).  
 * 
 * The predefined {@link #BROADCAST} channel is a channel instance
 * that implements the {@link Eligible} interface in such a way that
 * all criteria match. Events fired on the {@link #BROADCAST} channel
 * will therefore be accepted by all handlers (as its name suggests).
 * 
 * For ordinary usage, the implementing classes {@link ClassChannel}
 * and {@link NamedChannel} should be sufficient. If another type of
 * `Channel` is needed, its implementation must make sure that 
 * {@link Eligible#isEligibleFor(Object)} returns
 * `true` if called with `Channel.class` as parameter, else channels 
 * of the new type will not be delivered to "catch-all" handlers.
 * 
 * Objects of type <code>Channel</code> must be immutable.
 * 
 * @see Channel#BROADCAST
